## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of Airbnb prices based on various factors, such as the area (zipcode), time of the year, and the number of bedrooms in the Airbnb listings. The analysis was performed using Tableau to provide visual insights into the dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Key Insights

  - The visualization explores the cost distribution across different areas (zipcodes), helping users understand the pricing trends in specific regions.
  
- **Seasonal Trends:**
  - A comprehensive look into how Airbnb prices fluctuate based on the time of the year. This can aid both hosts and travelers in planning and decision-making.

- **Bedroom Count Impact:**
  - Analysis of how the number of bedrooms affects Airbnb prices. This provides valuable information for users looking to understand the cost variations based on accommodation size.
